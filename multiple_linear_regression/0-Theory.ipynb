English translations of the phrase include \"all other things being equal\" or \"other things held constant\" or \"all else unchanged\". A prediction or a statement about a causal, empirical, or logical relation between two states of affairs is ceteris paribus if it is acknowledged that the prediction, although usually accurate in expected conditions, can fail or the relation can be abolished by intervening factors._ --- <cite>Wikipedia</cite>\n",
