    "\n",
    "Is a way to answer a given question. First step is convert/transform this question in hypothesis. Then, gather data to answer/justify which hypothesis are likely to be true.\n",

    "\n",
    "The $H_0$ hypothesis is also known as _Null hypothesis_ and this hypothesis stand to be true **before** collect any data.\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "The $H_1$ hypothesis must be competing (in comparison with the $H_0$) and non-overlaping hypothesis.\n",

    "### Selecting a hypothesis\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\text{Which hypothesis is more likely to be True?} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two ways to select these hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Using Confidence Intervals: Sampling distribution of our statistics.\n",
    "2. Simulating what we believe to be true under the null hypothesis, and than seeing if our data is actually consistent with that\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Using Confidence Intervals\n",
    "\n",
    "Create the Confidence Intervals and check where is it.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example of coffee drinkers, the interval was entirely below 70, which would suggest the null (the population mean is less than 70) is actually true.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Bootstrapping a sample\n",
    "2. Calculate the statistics\n",
    "3. Plot the histogram to visualize\n",
    "4. Calculte the upper and lower bounds from the Confidence Intervals\n",
    "5. Check if the $H_0$ or $H_1$ is in this Confidence Interval.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Traditional way\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We assume the $H_0$ is `True`.\n",
    "2. We know the sampling distribution is normal\n",
    "3. We will use the closest value of the $H_0$, which is almost 70.\n",
    "4. Based on the standard deviation of the sampling distribution we could estimate the distribution from the $H_0$.\n",
    "5. Plot the histogram\n",
    "6. Check the statistics and the hypothesis $H_0$.\n",
    "7. Decide to reject $H_0$ or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "### P-value\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the Bootstrapping process the P-value could be interpreted as: a statistics of how many samples will be higher/lower than the threshold defined in the hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the exercises the P-value is an \"average\" of all 10,000 samples if it is higher, lower, or in the tails of a specific parameter. This \"average\" (in fact is a \"vector\" of zero or one due to the comparison) is the probability of a sample has higher/lower values from the parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bear in mind, if 100 samples say to reject the $H_0$ but the others 9,900 say the opposite there are a probability of 100/10,000 to incurr in error Type 1. In other words, the 100/10,000 is the so-called **p-value**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The relationship between **p-value** and $\\alpha$:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **p-value** $ < \\alpha$ (or small p-value): Reject $H_0$\n",
    "* **p-value** $\\geq \\alpha$ (or Large p-value): Fail to reject $H_0$\n",

    "[refe_lesson12_c4]: https://rebeccaebarnes.github.io/2018/05/01/what-is-a-p-value\n",

    "For a small $\\alpha$ (less than 10/10,000, for instance) probably you will accept the $H_0$, in the case of:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$H_0: \\mu \\leq 0 \\\\ H_1: \\mu > 0$$\n",
    "\n",
